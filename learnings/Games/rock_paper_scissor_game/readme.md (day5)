🧩 Day 5: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game in C# ✊📄✂️

Today, I learned how to make a simple yet fun game that interacts with the user and responds differently each time!

Key Concepts I Learned:

Random Number Generation: Used the Random class to make the computer choose Rock, Paper, or Scissor randomly (rnd.Next(0, 3)).

User Input Handling: Took the player’s choice using Console.ReadLine() and converted it to uppercase to make comparisons easier.

Decision-Making (if–else): Used multiple if-else statements to compare the user’s and computer’s choices and decide who wins or if it’s a draw.

Loops for Replay: Implemented a while loop with a boolean (playagain) to let the player play multiple rounds until they decide to stop.

Game Logic & Flow Control: Designed the structure so the program randomly responds, gives feedback, and asks if the user wants to play again.

This helped me understand how randomization, loops, and conditional logic can be combined to create an interactive and enjoyable console game experience.
