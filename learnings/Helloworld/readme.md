Here’s what I learned today 👇

💡 1. Structure of a C# Program
Every C# program has a clear structure. It starts with a namespace (a container that keeps related code together), then a class (which holds methods and logic), and finally a Main method, where the program actually starts running.

💡 2. Console Input and Output
I learned how to make my program “talk” to the user.
Console.WriteLine() is used to display messages on the screen, and Console.ReadLine() allows the user to type something back. This makes the program interactive instead of just showing text.

💡 3. Variables and Data Types
When I asked for a name or a number, I needed a place to store that information — that’s what variables are for.
I used a string variable for text (like a name) and converted the input to an integer (whole number) when I needed to do calculations.

💡 4. Type Conversion
All user input comes in as text, so if I want to perform math operations, I have to convert it to a number.
Learning how to change data types (like text → number) was really important today.

💡 5. Basic Arithmetic and String Combination
I practiced adding numbers and joining text together.
For example, I combined the user’s name with a greeting message and added numbers to create a fun output message.

💡 6. Logic and Flow
Seeing how the program flows from top to bottom helped me understand how computers follow instructions step by step — no skipping, no guessing. It only does exactly what you tell it to.

It was a small program, but it felt like a big first step — from writing my first “Hello World” to making the computer respond to me!
